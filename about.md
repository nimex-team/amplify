We're a team of developers based in Canada and we have a combined 25 years experience building highly scalable and secure SaaS applications. We also have experience in the fintech space and an active equities day trader. 

We’ve been following the progression of Nimiq since it was first announced on hckrnews and we’ve been following along ever since. With lack of exchanges to easily and securely exchange NIM we decided to build a simple UI & UX and intuitive exchange for the community to use.
